# WurmOnline Maps dot com client-side code

This is the ver 2.2 of the WO Maps code base, by Jackjones for WefNET.

## Changes from 2.0

- Got rid of the ASP.NET MVC wrapper. This web site is hosted with client-side files only built from the Typescript you see here.
- Data is now saved and retrieved from a Google spreadsheet.
- Got rid of Material Design in favor of PrimeNG

## Boring stuff

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.7.2.
